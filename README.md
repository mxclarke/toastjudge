# Angular 2 Toast Judge

This is a small demo project for a web app written in Angular 2/Typescript.

The project's foundation is the
[angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)
Typescript code.

Toast Judge is intended to assist judges at Toastmaster's contests.

More to come.
