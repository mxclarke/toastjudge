# Angular 2 Toast Judge

This is a small demo project for a web app written in Angular 2/Typescript.

The project's foundation is the
[angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)
Typescript code.

Toast Judge is intended to assist judges at Toastmaster's contests.

More to come.

Likely to be using PrimeNG components, http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/ and
https://www.npmjs.com/package/primeng. Quickstart package.json here: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng-quickstart/blob/master/package.json.
Followed the instructions here https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed/wiki/Add-PrimeNG
for adding PrimeNG.

Had a look at Google's Material Design project for Angular 2, but it is
still in alpha and most of the components I want have not yet been implemented:
https://github.com/angular/material2.
